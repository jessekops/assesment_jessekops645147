			A solar panel is a panel that converts sunlight in to current for electricity. A collection of PV modules is calles
			a PV panel. A system of these oanels is called an array. You can install a solar penal to your roof. But, solar panels 
			can also be installed on a platfor on the sea or big open grass fields. Solar panels are really trendy. In the nederlands
			the amount of houses with solar panels has doubled in the past four years.

			Every solar-powered system requieres regulation to prevent battery damage. It is basically a voltage and current regulator
			to keep batteries from overcharging. It regulates the power coming from the solar panels to the battery. If you do not have
			a charge controller your batteries will overcharge and will be damaged. You can see how much energy you generate by a monitor
			what will come with the controller most of the time.

			<p
			class = "text-article">
			A battery system is an important part of the solar panels. The battery system is used for energy that you do not use at the moment.
			if you do not use it, it stores it so you can use the extra energy on a later mmoment. This is very handy because when there is no sun
			for a while you can use the extra stored up energy. It is wisely to invest a bit more on a battery system because it is so important.

		DC power

			<p
			class = "text-article">
			Direct current power is the one directional flow of electric charge. DC power is eseential for the use of almost every electronical device
			characteristic of this source is that the two poles have a standard polarity. Which means it goes straight from + to -. In comperising to AC power 
			it is cheaper to change the voltage and the loss of energy is way smaller over long distances.

		Inverter

			<p
			class = "text-article">
			A solar of PV inverter is a electrical converter which converts the DC power into a alternating current (AC). The AC current  can be fed into
			grid. It is critical in a solar system because it allows the use of ordinary AC powered equipment. You have micro inverters who are very small but very
			usefull for a small system. Bigger inverters are used for bigger systems like whole streets powered by solar energy or big buildings.

		AC power
		</h1>
		</header>
			<p
			class = "text-article">
			AC power, also know as alternating current. Is a current which can flow to multiple directions which Direct Current cannot. AC power is the power that is delivered by 
			electricity company's to your own house. It is more expensive then DC power because it has more energy loss over longer distances and to change the voltage is more expensive.
			But the AC power type is still more used then DC power.
